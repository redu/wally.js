# About
A client for Redu's wall service ([Wally](https://github.com/redu/wally)). It's made with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and bundled with [jbundle](https://github.com/ismasan/jbundle).

# Usage
Wally.js is an Ember application that consumes Wally API. It's very simple to add it yo your project, let's see.

First you need to include wally.js on your app:

```html
<script src="wally.min.js"></script>
```

After that, you need to copy all templates inside [src/templates](https://github.com/redu/wally.js/blob/master/src/templates/templates.html) and put it on your HTML's `<head>`.

Finally, instantiate the Wally app and be happy:

```js
/** Initialize the WallyClient and gets the specified Wall
 *
 * opts
 *  A set of key/value pairs that configures the WallyClient.
 *
 *  token (String)
 *    The key used to get access on the Wally Server
 *  resourceId (String)
 *    Basically the Wall's owner
 *  rootElement (String) [optional]
 *    Where the WallyApp should be rendered. By default, the app is
 *    appended to the body.
 *  corsLinks (Boolean) [optional]
 *    Default is false.
 *    Indicates that the links should be opened in the app's parent.
 *    For example: If the app is inside an iframe and you need the links
 *    to be opened inside the browser instead of inside the iframe, set
 *    it to true.
 *  user (Object)
 *    The logged in user
 *  target (Object)
 *    Where the post will be posted
 *  context (Array) [optional]
 *    Like breadcrumbs, so the post will be contextualized
 *  config (Object)
 *    Specific configurations
 *
 *    showContexts (Boolean)
 *      Default is false.
 *      Specify if the contexts should be showed.
 *

  resourceId: "core:space_1",
  rootElement: '#my-div',

# Under the skin
Wally.js and Wally service made an agreement so they can talk to each other, this agreement is based on JSON and defined urls.
For more detailed information, visit Wally service's [page](https://github.com/redu/wally).

## Wally entities
The Wally service is made of some entities, these are:

1. Wall
2. Post
3. Answer
4. Author

To explain a little about them, a `Wall` has many `Post` which in turn has many `Answer`. A `Post` and an `Answer` are made by an `Author`, who can create many `Post` and `Answer`.

### Entities' URLs
Of course, almost every entity is mapped to an URL on Wally service. The exception is `Author`, because it is treated as an embedded entity, ie we don't need to access it through and URl because it is already inside the `Post` and `Answer` structure.

* Wall
    - GET `/walls/:resource_id` (get a Wall)
* Post
    - GET `/posts/:id` (get a Post)
    - POST `/posts` (create a Post)
    - DELETE `/posts/:id` (delete a Post)
* Answer
    - GET `/answers/:id` (get an Answer)
    - POST `/answers` (create an Answer)
    - DELETE `/answers/:id` (delete an Answer)

### Entities' structure
The entities' structure returned by the Wally server are described below:

GET `/walls/core:space_1`
```js
{
  "wall" : {
    "id": 1,

## Next steps
1. Precompile handlebars templates

## Development setup
You do not need to install a thing, because all you need is already inside the repository.

We use [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for tests, but don't worry because it's all set up. You just need to run the static files server (with jBundle) and open the `test/runner.html` and all tests will run on the browser and present to you a report with a clean layout.
```
# Start static files server
wally.js $ jbundle s
```

## Bundle wally.js
You just need to set to the correct version number in `JFile` and run `jbundle`. Remember that to run `jbundle` you need to run `bundle` first, so this dependencie will be installed.

```sh
# Install dependencies
wally.js $ bundle
# Generate version specified at JFile
wally.js $ jsbundle
Writing to dist/0.0.1/wally.js
Writing to dist/0.0.1/wally.min.js
Writing to dist/0.0/wally.js
Writing to dist/0.0/wally.min.js
```

# On the skin
If you want the great layout provided by [Redu Bootstrap](https://github.com/redu/ui-components)'s components, you should download it and you can use this structure:

```html
<html>
    <head>
      <script src="jquery-1.7.2.min.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap-redu.css">
      <script src="js/vendor/modernizr.js"></script>

      <!-- Include templates (src/templates) here -->
      <script src="wally.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Do the Wally App initialization here -->
      <script src="js/vendor/jquery.tokeninput.js"></script>
      <script src="js/vendor/jquery.autosize.min.js"></script>
      <script src="js/vendor/placeholder-polyfill.min.js"></script>
      <script src="js/bootstrap-redu.js"></script>
      <script src="http://use.typekit.com/lpo4rgu.js"></script>
      <script>try{Typekit.load(); $(".typekit-badge").remove();}catch(e){}</script>
    </body>
</html>
```
